First create the **Virtual Environment** and the **kernel**.
**01.** Go to the respective folder structure when you want to create it.

       Open Anaconda Powershell Prompt -> cd " (file path) "
**02.** Execute the command.

**04.** After activate the relevent environment next required kernel has to be created kernel will link the customized package assembly jupitor as relevent environment.

**05.** Execute the below command to activate the kernel installation.

        pip install ipykernel
**06.** Once the kernel is install executed the command for kernel link in development environment.

        python -m ipykernel install --name (type any name 01)

- Go to the ANACONDA Navigator -> Open jupitor NoteBook.

- Then the right side of the page.

      Click new -> select the Kernel (type any name 01) -> open it



## Then type these code in the jupitor Notebook
